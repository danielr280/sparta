SPARTA is a terrible acronym for "Scanning platform for assisting in
reverse-engineering, testing, and auditing".  The basic idea is to automate the
process of identifying potential targets on Linux systems and leveraging
package managers to download source code.  It currently enumerates setuid
applications and all listening network services.  If run as root, it reliably
identifies the application associated with each listening port using lsof.
Otherwise, it makes a best guess based on available information from ps and a
list of port-service mappings provided in ports.conf.

It's all in Ruby, and uses ncurses for the old-school terminal interface.
